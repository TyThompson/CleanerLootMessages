# Cleaner Loot Messages
The only purpose of this lightweight Addon is to reduce the loot messages to a minimum for a clearer information.
 

For example, your loot will be displayed as :
"+ [object_name]"

For a party member :
"+ [player_name] : [object_name]"

For a multiple craft of a party member :
"+ [player_name]: [object_name]x2 (craft)"

 

Work for group loot, craft, harvesting, reputation, XP ...

 

This addon is really light and has an extremely low impact on the game as it only redefine the way the message are formated.
